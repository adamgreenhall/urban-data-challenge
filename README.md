[The Urban Data Challenge](https://github.com/swissnexSF/Urban-Data-Challenge)
============================================================

We can plot using [d3 and leaflet](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/leaflet/) along 
with [topojson](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/map/).
 
Also a handy reference is the [d3 book](https://github.com/alignedleft/d3-book).

Time series data is getting parsed by ipython notebooks (one per city, since the formats are different).

Serving it up, now with [stasis](http://stasis.me/):

    cd web; stasis -d 3000
