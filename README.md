# swissnex-urbandata-challenge

This repository provides you with public transportation data sets from Zurich, San Francisco and Geneva for the www.urbandatachallenge.org. 

Throughout the repository you'll find the data organized by city. Each city folder contains the data sets and a more detailed description of the data. 

Explore the [Public Transportation](https://github.com/swissnexSF/Urban-Data-Challenge/tree/master/public-transportation) data sets for [Zurich](https://github.com/swissnexSF/Urban-Data-Challenge/tree/master/public-transportation/zurich), [Geneva](https://github.com/swissnexSF/Urban-Data-Challenge/tree/master/public-transportation/geneva), and [San Francisco](https://github.com/swissnexSF/Urban-Data-Challenge/tree/master/public-transportation/san-francisco). 
We've also added [available weather data sets](https://github.com/swissnexSF/Urban-Data-Challenge/tree/master/weather) for the two Swiss cities. These data are *meant to complement the public transportation data sets*. You're free to use them in any way you like, as long as they add context to public transportation data. 

## Additional Information
You will come across a lot of terms when sifting through the data sets. To help you understand them, we put together a  [Glossary](https://github.com/swissnexSF/Urban-Data-Challenge/wiki/Glossary).
